### 🤖 AuraCool Strategy Brief — {city_name}

**Thermal Threat Level:** {threat_level}  
**Public Health Outlook:** {health_msg}

### 📊 Thermal Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Baseline Surface Temperature** | {base_temp:.1f}°C |
| **Optimized Scenario Temperature** | {new_temp:.1f}°C |
| **Projected Cooling Gain** | {reduction:.1f}°C |
| **Urban Hotspot Percentage** | {urban_hotspot_pct:.1f}% |

---

### 🎯 Strategic Priority

**{priority}**

Immediate action is required. With an investment of approximately **${budget_musd:.1f}M**, AuraCool predicts a cooling of **{reduction:.1f}°C** across the city's hottest zones.

---

### 🌳 Urban Fabric Actions

1. **Green Infrastructure:**
   - {roof_plan}
   - Expand tree canopy along heat-intense transit corridors and pedestrian plazas
   - Plant 50,000+ fast-growing shade trees in underserved districts  
{tree_line}
2. **Cool Pavements & Surfaces:**
   - Paint roads and parking lots with high-albedo reflective coatings
   - Target at least 15% of paved surfaces for reflectivity upgrade  
{paint_line}
3. **Cooling Centers:**
   - Deploy mobile cooling buses and shaded pop-up corridors during red-alert heat days
   - Retrofit public buildings with passive cooling (green walls, water features)

---

### 💰 Budget Intelligence

**Estimated Investment:** ${budget_musd:.1f}M  
**Projected Annual Energy Savings:** ≈ ${energy_saving_est:.1f}M  
**Cost Recovery Period:** ≈ {max(1, int(budget_musd / (energy_saving_est + 0.1)))} years

**Highest ROI Targets:**
- Dense, low-income high-rise districts with poor tree cover
- Industrial areas with large dark roof surfaces
- Transit hubs and pedestrian thoroughfares

---

### ✅ Expected Outcomes

✓ Reduced heat-related hospital admissions by 15-25%  
✓ Lower air conditioning energy consumption  
✓ Improved air quality from increased vegetation  
✓ Enhanced public spaces and outdoor accessibility  
✓ Economic stimulus through green jobs
